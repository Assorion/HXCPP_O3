# HXCPP With O3

This repository is only intended for use in Github workflows. 

The current HXCPP version here is an older version, and also has a few changes made to the toolchains.  
Mostly adding several compiler optimizations in order to speed up Assorion Engine. Please do not use this outside of that.

This repo also contains builds of the CPPIA files in order to be used straight with any project.
